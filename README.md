BUAD 689 Spring 2021 Assignment 1 - Ryan David

I'd like to learn more about GIT for sure, code management, checking in and out, branching and overall lifecycle management.
I'm thankful for this class because I have been pretty lost once a model is built in SAS or python - really looking forward to this!
